FREMAX: IS PROVABLY SECURE LINGUISTIC STEGANOGRAPHY THE END?

Generative Linguistic Steganography (GLS) is a popular
technique that utilizes Language Models (LMs) to hide se-
cret messages within seemingly innocuous texts. GLS aims
to generate steganographic texts (stegos) similar to normal
carrier texts (covers). The mainstream GLS method, Prov-
ably Secure Steganography(PSS), has developed to guaran-
tee imperceptibility between stegos and covers. However,
there exists a statical difference between LM-generated texts
and human texts, making the stegos more detectable. To
bridge the gap between stegos and covers, this paper pro-
posed a probability reformation method named Frequency
REformed Softmax (FREmax) for generating highly imper-
ceptible stegos aligned to natural language. We reformed the
softmax function based on the tokensâ€™ frequency distribution
of human corpus. Extensive experimental results show that
FREmax can improve the linguistic quality and impercepti-
bility of the generated stegos, proving it a valuable remedy to
existing GLS methods.
